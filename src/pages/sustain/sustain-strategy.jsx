      Furthermore, Sustainable Procurement plays a key role in the development
      of our operations, as can be seen in our Responsible Sourcing and
      Responsible Supply-chain policies. We maintain the highest standards in
      our relationships with our suppliers, in terms of quality policy and
      purchasing strategy. We take into account the specific risks that are
      currently linked to certain materials, in line with the OECD Due Diligence
      Guidance.
    </p>,
    <p>
      The companyâ€™s activities are transparent in material handling, safety and
      radiation protection. We collaborate with suppliers that adhere to
      sustainable practices and we will foster trust in our suppliers by
      providing transparent transaction procedures. We believe that through
      sustainable procurement, we can motivate other suppliers to improve the
      environmental and social impact in their own production process and,
      therefore, actively contribute to sustainable development.
    </p>,
    <p>
      Lastly, as part of monitoring and enhancing our sustainability
      performance, a Sustainability Committee will be established, which will be
      supervised by the CEO. It will be the highest sustainability decision
      making body within the organization, that audits and evaluates the current
      status of sustainable management.
    </p>,

    <p>
      The Committee will be responsible for improving the integration of
      sustainability measures across the company and will provide guidance and
      supervision for the fulfilment of its sustainability obligations related
      to the economy, environment, society and future plans.
    </p>,
    <p>
      It will provide reports, recommendations, and will establish policies
      about sustainability matters in a transparent manner that fits our
      governance structure and supports our vision. The Committee will resolve
      any primary sustainability issues and aim to mitigate any risks that can
      occur as part of its business activities. It will also engage in
      discussions through, for example, meetings, and workshops about
      introducing new measures or improving existing ones in order to ensure its
      sustainability goals. It is our mission to make continuous improvements to
      our sustainability strategy, meet our goals and bring value to the
      environment, economy, and society
