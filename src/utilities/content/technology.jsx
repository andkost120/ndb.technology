            "NDB is one of the earliest adopters and developers of atomic voltaic cells for mid and high-power applications.

            "Nuclear batteries have been around for some time, but they are limited to low-power applications due to their efficiency. NDB optimizes this technology for high-power applications. We propose to reuse nuclear fuel by recycling it to extract radioisotopes. Isotopes from recycled nuclear waste or a reactor release a high level of energy particles that can be transformed into usable energy.",
