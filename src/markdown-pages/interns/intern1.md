My experience at NDB was very good. I got to put my scientific knowledge to use and learn a whole new technology as in depth as it gets.

I was also pushed to develop soft skills by my superiors being flexible in the tasks that I was assigned, and responding to my ideas and requests, I appreciate that greatly.

I was trusted with tasks other than research, like giving presentations, and joining in with many exterior business meetings. NDB gives very interesting set of knowledge, and skills for a young scientist as it is working on revolutionary technology.

Confidence is number one. I was lucky enough to be trusted with high importance tasks which allowed for a fast development of responsibility and self worth. I really enjoyed this and will remember it fondly..
