title: "NDB T1"
# slug: "tab4"
# data: "The underlying principles that govern a nuclear voltaic cell are the conservation of energy and momentum. The kinetic energy of incident radiation is converted to electricity by a transducer resulting in an inelastic scattering reaction. At NDB, we have identified transducers that can theoretically exceed the efficiency of the previous generation nuclear batteries and operate at a wide power output range."
