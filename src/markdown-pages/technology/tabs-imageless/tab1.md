# data: "NDB aims at converting power from more than one type of radiation and therefore has a broad spectrum of radioisotopes to power its nuclear voltaic cell. It can achieve this feat by using a unique and flexible design structure compatible with its prospective radioisotopes. NDB technology will overcome the world’s energy source problems by safely generating electricity from nuclear waste or radioisotopes for years, ranging up to the hundreds. This makes NDB’s technology system the best market and environmentally friendly battery system."
