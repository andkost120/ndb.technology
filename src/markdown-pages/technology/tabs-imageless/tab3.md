# data: "All radioisotopes are known to produce high amounts of heat. The strategic placement of the source and the NDB cells optimizes inelastic scattering within certain designated materials in the nuclear voltaic cell. This design also captures the heat and light due to the ionization of the electrons produced by the radioisotope and enables rapid conversion to usable electricity."
