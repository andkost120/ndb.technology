title: "Thin-Film Structure"
# slug: "tab2"
# data: "The individual thickness of the cell is one of the critical parameters as the energy produced can be deposited within the radioisotope region; this is called internal absorption. The thin-film profile exhibited by NDB allows radiation to be absorbed in the collector with minimal self-absorption in the emitter and transformed into usable energy by the converter. Due to its flexible design structure, this technology can take any shape per application."
