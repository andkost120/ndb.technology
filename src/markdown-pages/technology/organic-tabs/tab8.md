Quantumaro represents a massive breakthrough in the Computation Power Unit field as it allows further developments in the IT sector. Chipsets are the most sensitive and core parts of electronic devices; the Quantumaro combines nuclear voltaic and tunneling diode to channel the generated charge into one side of the diode, effectively charging the diode contact. Then, this is a self-powered binary signal generator.
