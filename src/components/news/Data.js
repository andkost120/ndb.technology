You are welcome to browse some portions of the NDB website without becoming a registered user. For some services or areas on the site, we will ask that you register if you have not already done so and provide us with information about you and/or your company such as name, job title, email address, and other types of information which enable us to provide services and information to you. Once we provide you with a user name and password you will be able to access other parts of our site. If you order from our online catalog or use other services available through our site, we may ask you to provide further information, including but not limited to financial information, equipment information, and other personal information. We may collect other personal information when you provide comments or participate in surveys.
If you use our site to enroll in offline educational courses or to take courses online, we may collect additional course registration information. 
</p>
<p>
In addition, for your convenience, NDB may collect and maintain your course credit history. Our Human Resources staff will review and process your application if you use our online job search program. If no opportunities are available at this time, we may keep your information on file for purposes of identifying future employment opportunities for you at NDB.
If you provide us with personal data about other individuals, please ensure that they are aware of such a provision and check our privacy policy.
</p>
<p>
If you participate in any group forums or use other interactive tools (such as message boards or chat rooms) available on or through the NDB site, you should use care not to disclose your personal information. In general, such forums may be viewed by others who visit the site.
The NDB site uses two types of cookies. "Cookies" are small data files, typically made up of a string of text and numbers, which assign you a unique identifier. A "client cookie" is sent to your browser so that our systems remember your requests and keep track of the pages you view on our site and which services you use. A "server cookie" is maintained on our systems to recognise you when you return to the site. This information allows us to better administer the site and provide a more tailored and user-friendly service to you. You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to prevent cookies from being sent; if so, you may limit the functionality we can provide you when you visit our site.
</p>
<p>
In addition, NDB works with third parties to serve advertisements on our sites. These ads may contain cookies that are maintained or tracked by the ad server or advertiser. NDB does not control or have access to the advertiser cookies.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we collect aggregate information about the use of our site, such as which pages are most frequently visited, how many visitors we receive daily, and how long visitors stay on each page.
NDB strives to have in place appropriate means to protect your information. However, in providing your information over a public or third-party network, you do so at your own risk.

    <p>
    If you order products or services from us, we may maintain an order history for your account. We also may combine information you have provided to us in communications offline with the information you have given us online (or vice versa) to provide a more customized experience for you when you deal with us. 
    </p>
    <p>
    We use demographic and site usage information collected from visitors to improve the usefulness of our site and to prepare aggregate, non-identifying information used in marketing, site advertising, or similar activities.

    By visiting our website and providing us with data, you acknowledge and agree that due to the international dimension of our company we may use the data collected in the course of our relationship for the purposes identified in this policy, for the purposes identified in our other communications with you, or to provide the information to other NDB businesses and selected third parties which may be outside your resident jurisdiction. 
    </p>

    In addition, such data may be stored on servers located in other jurisdictions. By providing us with your data, you consent to the transfer of such data.

    We may provide to others the aggregate statistics about our customers' orders or related site activity for purposes of marketing or promotion.
