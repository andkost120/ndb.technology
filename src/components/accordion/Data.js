          Modern life is heavily reliant on mobile battery-powered devices
          affecting daily aspects of our lives, ranging from telecommunication
          devices to transport vehicles and beyond earth in aerospace
          technology.

          There is an increasing demand for efficient and cost-effective
          batteries from manufacturers, meaning a constant need to improve
          current affairs. Conventional batteries have been riddled with
          numerous concerns. In the age of increasing consciousness about global
          warming and waste accumulation, production must align with sustainable
          development principles and qualitative change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, this innovation can solve the global problem of nuclear
          waste. Nuclear power is beneficial, but it has its shortcomings in the
          nuclear waste it produces. This is a costly problem that is costing
          over US$ 100 billion globally. Our innovation is made from recycled
          nuclear waste and, therefore, will address this issue, making nuclear
          power a greener option than before.

          The UN has set a goal of becoming net-zero emission by 2050 to
